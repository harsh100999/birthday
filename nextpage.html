        <h2>🎉 Happy 18 Birthday, My Bebu! 🎉</h2>
        <p>
            Today is a special day because it's the day you came into this world and, more importantly, 
            into my life! 🥳 Over the past **2.5 years**, we've shared unforgettable memories, countless 
            laughs, and some of the craziest adventures. Through all the ups and downs, one thing has remained 
            constant—our friendship. 💖
        </p>
        <p>
            We've been through so much together. From late-night talks to supporting each other during 
            tough times, our bond has only grown stronger. Even though life can be unpredictable, one thing 
            I'm sure of is that I'll always be here for you, just like you've always been there for me. 
        </p>
        <p>
            You are one of the most genuine, kind, and amazing people I know, and I feel so lucky to 
            call you my friend. No matter where life takes us, I know our friendship will always remain 
            unbreakable. 💕
        </p>
        <p>
            So here's to celebrating YOU today! May this year bring you endless happiness, success, and 
            everything your heart desires. Love you So much, bestie! 🎂🎁💃
